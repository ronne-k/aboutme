## üöÄ About Me

I'm currently pursuing my **MS in Computer Science** at **Northeastern University, Seattle**, with a passion for **Machine Learning and AI**. 

My journey began in **Quantitative Finance** at **Ernst & Young**, where I discovered my interest in **forecasting** which at the time felt very akin to truly predicting the future. Now, I‚Äôm diving into the world of **ML & AI**, driven by the goal to create technology that **thinks, learns, and improves lives**. 

Inspired by experiences like seeing Tesla's self-driving features in action and most recently Meta's AR glasses I hope to get my hands on someday, I aim to build impactful AI solutions, from small tools to big innovations. 

**Let's build something amazing together!**
