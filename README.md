# üëã Howdy, I'm Ronne! 

> Who is Ronne you ask? Great question.

I am currently in my second semester of **MS Computer Science** program at **Northeastern University (in Seattle!)** with a passion for Machine Learning and AI. My journey into the world of machine learning engineering began in my first career path where I worked in Quantitative Finance & forecasting at Ernst & Young and discovered what interested me in that work was the forecasting-- taking factors someone was interested in and using math and a healthy amount of mathematical guessing (margin of error and tolerance of risk) to see what the future might hold. From that job I began trying to pivot and dive deeper into the world of data science and working in Machin Learning in the cloud on GCP platform at KPMG. And I took the jump to start my masters in Computer Science!

I know ML & AI are hot topics right now. The shiny new tool in the toolbox. And, after witnessing my dad's Tesla's self-driving feature in action, I was hit with the profound answer I'd been searching for in my career post-undergrad: **"I want to build that."**

Ever since, I have been captivated by the idea of creating technology that **thinks, learns, and ultimately improves how we live**. Whether it's self-driving cars, tools to explore "SPACE, the final frontier", or small AI solutions that improve our everyday lives , my goal is to contribute to projects that push the boundaries of what's possible. From micro to macro levels, I want to build it all. **Let's build together!** 

## üìã The TLDR Version: 
- I am studying **Computer Science MS @ Northeastern University in Seattle**
- I started my career in Quantitative Finance @ Ernst & Young and realized I wanted to build models that coule improve our everyday lives
- That led me to the ML/AI field which is what I would like to pursue now.
- **I want to build all kinds of AI solutions**
