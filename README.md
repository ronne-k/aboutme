# ðŸ‘‹ Howdy, I'm Ronne! 

> Who is Ronne you ask? Great question.

I am currently in my second semester of MS Computer Science program at Northeastern University (in Seattle!) with a passion for Machine Learning and AI. My journey into the world of machine learning engineering began in my first career path where I worked in Quantitative Finance & forecasting at Ernst & Young and discovered what interested me in that work was the forecasting-- taking factors someone was interested in and using math and a healthy amount of mathematical guessing (margin of error and tolerance of risk) to see what the future might hold. From that job I began trying to pivot and dive deeper into the world of data science and working in Machin Learning in the cloud on GCP platform at KPMG. And I took the jump to start my masters in Computer Science!

I know ML & AI are hot topics right now. The shiny new tool in the toolbox. And, after witnessing a Tesla's self-driving feature in action, I was hit with the profound answer I'd been searching for in my career post-undergrad: "I want to build that."

Ever since, I have been captivated by the idea of creating technology that thinks, learns, and ultimately improves how we live. Whether it's self-driving cars, space ships to explore "the final frontier", or other innovative AI solutions, my goal is to contribute to projects that push the boundaries of what's possible. From micro to macro levels, I want to build it all. Let's build together!
